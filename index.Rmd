# Introduction {#intro}

```{r include = FALSE}
library(knitr)
```


This is my personal collection statistical notes and citations which 
serves as a reference I can use when helping natural scientists do their statistics in R.

This is not intended to be a Statistical Textbook. There are lots of those, 
many freely available online. What I have found a lack of, is clear instructions
for how to *apply* and, almost more importantly, *interpret* statistics in R.
I have also found a lack of a list of simple best practices.

Consider this a **Practical Guide to performing statistics in R for Natural Scientists**.
In places I do include some statistical guidance, but generally speaking I assume
some background in statistics. This is not a source for understanding the underlying 
theory of statistics!

Everywhere possible I cite my information be it a stackoverflow question or an
academic journal article. 
If you have a citation you think I should include or think there's something I'm missing, 
please open an issue in the GitHub repository and let me know (ideally with a citation!)

## Getting Started

Throughout these examples we'll be using the awesome palmerpenguins package as our example data.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

(ref:allison) Artwork by [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "(ref:allison)"}
include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png")
```

Check out the data:

```{r}
penguins
```
